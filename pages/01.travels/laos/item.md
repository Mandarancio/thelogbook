Laos can be divided in 3 main regions, the north, the center and the south reagion. This is the only country of the Indochina Peninsula without access to the sea and it is sorrounded by China in the North, Myanmar in the North-West, Thailand in the West, Cambodia in the South/South-West and Vietnam in the East side.
During the _Vietnam War_ and the _Secret War_ it has been bombarded by americans and most of the cities has been destroyed, morever an huge quantity of unexploded bombs are still around, during this time the country recived the biggest number of bomb of the entire history.

## Formalities
**Visas** are needed however it is possible to do it on arrival at the main airport and at most of the land crossing (complete list and more information [here](http://www.laos-guide-999.com/laos-visa-on-arrival.html)). 
A valid passport and a picture are required at the border and the cost should be of around 30$.

## North Laos

This will be probably the first region we will visit, the access can be done or by plane to one of its main airports (*Vientiane* or *Luang Prabang*) or by land at one of the Thai-Laos border crossing point (probably at _Chiangkhong â€“ Houixay_ border).
